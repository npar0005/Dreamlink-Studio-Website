          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            What started as a casual conversation between two students during a boring lecture, ignited the passion for beginning an adventure that will see them transform into a multi-disciplinary team with a focus on developing products that are enjoyable and impacts our community. 
            Dreamlink Studio is a software development start-up with an emphasis on transforming dreams into reality. We have a strong belief that with the increased need for students of all ages to carry out independent learning, it is vital to provide the right tools to set them up for success. Gone are the days of reading textbooks and memorising theories; now is the time for us to take control of how we learn. Whether it be creating the next application or planning our next move, our imaginations will drive us to our next innovation and milestone. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Our journey has just begun.

          When he's not building or testing out rhythm game controller pads, Jeffrey loves to find the humor in this weird world that we live in. He strives to provide a different point of view to make others think about how things could be done better and more efficient. Watch out though, he's always armed with a wild set of ideas to load a cannon with, mostly to try and hit the broad side of a barn. Other than indulging reality, Jeffrey specializes in design work, UI and UX implementation, coding, and moderation.

          At Dreamlink Justine leads the UI/UX team and is also a member of the graphics team.
          She is currently a student studying Commerce (Marketing) and IT (Business information systems). This is her first project in UI & graphics design and her first time learning about and doing 3D modelling, where she taught herself how to use Maya mainly with the help of YouTube. Justine is interested in design and creativity as it allows her imagination to come to life. She is striving towards a career in UI/UX and brand design. 
          In her spare time Justine likes to shop (window shop :P), try new food & watch movies.
          She also has the cutest golden retriever puppy (Kirby) which is secretly the 9th member of the team.

          HW is a mathematical person and enjoys being in the pool. She's also a chatter box and loves to immerse herself within the Chinese culture. 
          She's not into aesthetics but she ended up in graphics. Don’t ask her how because even she doesn't know. HW is a very fresh graduate 
          with an innocent mind and no impurities. She really likes working within a team as well as on her own.
